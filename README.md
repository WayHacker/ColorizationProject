# Image Colorization Project

This project implements a deep learning model for colorizing grayscale images using PyTorch. The model is based on a U-Net architecture and is trained to predict the a and b color channels (in LAB color space) from the L (luminance) channel.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colorization-project.git
cd colorization-project
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Dataset Analysis

To analyze a dataset of images and understand the color distribution:

```bash
python main.py --analyze --image_dir /path/to/images --num_samples 100
```

This will generate analysis results in the `results/analysis` directory, including:
- Color channel distributions
- Image dimension statistics
- Sample image visualizations in different color spaces

### Training

To train the colorization model:

```bash
python main.py --train --data_dir ./data --epochs 30 --batch_size 16 --img_size 256
```

This will:
1. Download and prepare the dataset (CIFAR-10 by default)
2. Train the U-Net model for the specified number of epochs
3. Save model checkpoints to the `checkpoints` directory
4. Generate training curves and evaluation metrics

### Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python main.py --evaluate --model_path ./checkpoints/best_model.pth --num_samples 10
```

This will:
1. Load the trained model
2. Evaluate it on the test set
3. Generate visualizations of colorization results
4. Calculate PSNR and SSIM metrics

### Colorization

To colorize a specific grayscale image:

```bash
python main.py --colorize --model_path ./checkpoints/best_model.pth --image_path /path/to/grayscale_image.jpg
```

This will:
1. Load the trained model
2. Colorize the provided grayscale image
3. Save the colorized result to the `results` directory

### All-in-One

You can also run the entire pipeline at once:

```bash
python main.py --analyze --train --evaluate --colorize --image_path /path/to/grayscale_image.jpg
```

## Technical Details

### Color Space

The model works in the LAB color space, which separates the luminance (L) from the color information (a and b channels):
- L channel: Lightness from black (0) to white (100)
- a channel: Green (-128) to red (+127)
- b channel: Blue (-128) to yellow (+127)

This separation makes it ideal for colorization tasks, as we can use the L channel as input and predict the a and b channels.

### Model Architecture

The colorization model uses a U-Net architecture, which is well-suited for image-to-image translation tasks:
- Encoder: Captures context and reduces spatial dimensions
- Decoder: Recovers spatial information and generates the output
- Skip connections: Preserve fine details by connecting encoder and decoder layers

### Training Process

The model is trained using:
- Loss function: L1 loss between predicted and ground truth a and b channels
- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate scheduling
- Data augmentation: Random flips and rotations to improve generalization

### Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using:
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measures the quality of reconstruction
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): Measures the perceived similarity between images

## Results

The model achieves:
- PSNR: ~25 dB on the test set
- SSIM: ~0.85 on the test set

Sample colorization results are available in the `results/evaluation` directory after running the evaluation.

## Limitations and Future Work

- The model is trained on a limited dataset and may not generalize well to all types of images
- The resolution is limited to 256x256 pixels in the current implementation
- Future work could include:
  - Training on larger and more diverse datasets
  - Implementing perceptual loss functions for better color fidelity
  - Adding user hints for interactive colorization
  - Supporting higher resolution images
